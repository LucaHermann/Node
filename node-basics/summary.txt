**How the web works :** 

- client => request => server => response => client


**Program lifecycle & event loop :** 

- Node.js runs a non-blocking JS code and uses an event-driven code (event loop) for running your logic.
- A Node Program exit as soon as there no more work to do.
- Note: The createServer() event never finishes by default.


**Asynchronous code :** 

- JS code is non-blocking, but it's not asynchronous.
- Use Callbacks ans events => Order changes.


**Request & Response :** 

- Parse request data in chunks.
- Avoid double response.


**Node.js & Core modules :** 

- Node.js is ships with multiple built-in modules.
- Use require() to include core modules.
- Core modules can be imported into any files to be used there.


**Node Module System :** 

- Node uses CommonJS modules system.
- Use module.exports to export code.
- Use require() to import code.
